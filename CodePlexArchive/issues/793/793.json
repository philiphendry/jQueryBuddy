The html pages will be running in the context of a Web Development Server hosted in the AppData path of jQueryBuddy and will be looking for it locally on disk in the Virtual Directory it's set up. You could either specify a full path name (might need prefix file:/// ?) or you could also use a CDN server if the file is hosted there - both Google and Microsoft offer those.",
